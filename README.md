This repository is based on the original LIGO Center for Open Science Tutorial Repository. 

In the LOSC_Event_tutorial.ipynb, it mainly covers the analysis of gravitational wave data from the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) Open Science Center (LOSC). The tutorial provides an introduction to gravitational waves and explains how to access and analyze the data using Python.

Viewers can also check environment.yml for dependencies.
